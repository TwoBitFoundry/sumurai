# Incident Response Policy — Two Bit Foundry

**Purpose:**  
Define how we detect, respond to, and recover from security incidents.

**Phases**
1. **Detection:** automated alerts + manual reports.  
2. **Containment:** isolate affected resources.  
3. **Eradication:** remove threat, rotate credentials.  
4. **Recovery:** restore from clean backups.  
5. **Post-mortem:** document cause + improvements.

**Notification**
- Notify impacted users within 72 hours of confirmed breach.  
- Notify partners (e.g., Teller, Plaid) immediately if data exposure involves their API.

**Testing:** Table-top drill annually.
